>**I'm going to make an offer that he can't refuse**  
<small>_-a famous dialogue from **The Godfather** movie._</small>


I was travelling in a cab last night, the driver didn't know the route.  He was completely depending on a map application for reaching the destination.

By following up with the route and the live traffic updates, few questions were raised in my mind.

- Who provides the data for each road/street updated in the Map application?
- Who provides the data for live traffic updates?  

I recently have seen a video in which a CEO of a company who owns the map application, was explaining how machine learning improves the accuracy of reading street signs, numbers of the buildings etc.  But, how frequently the company sends vehicles with camera to capture street view images?

Obviously, **we the people** who uses the map application provide all the data as crowd source information. Somehow, we all tied up with smartphones and an indirect connection that stores all our daily activities in some place in the form of data.

The crowd sourced data is being used to analyze and the output is provided to all other people, which are the free services that we get. We reached a stage, where we use such services everyday in our life.

Once a wise man said, ***"If You're Not Paying for It; You're the Product!!"*** which is perfectly applicable for this scenario.

Now read the first line of this post.  The godfather is making an offer, which we can't refuse.
